## Skills
- Although I am still new to programming, I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, Java, and Visual Basic.
- I also have experience with web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects
- I have a GitHub organization called "[Useless Projects](https://www.github.com/Useless-Projects)" where I post my various projects, including [GPS Frame Parser](https://github.com/Useless-Projects/GPS-Frame-Parser) (a NMEA frame decoder) and other useless projects.
- I'm always working on new projects, and I'm constantly improving my skills by learning new things and experimenting with different technologies.

## Interests
- In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, particularly FPS (CoD), simulation (ETS2, Bus Sim 21), and sandbox games (Gmod, Satisfactory).
- I also love creating animated wallpapers on [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine), and you can check out some of my work on [my workshop page](https://www.steamcommunity.com/id/TSGAMEMING/myworkshopfiles/?appid=431960&sort=score&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).
- Additionally, I enjoy creating maps on [Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website) to improve my skills for modding in Source games.
- Lastly, I love reading manga.
